# tess_svg
Converts SVG files to vertexes in different formats, like Java code/Json/C++ etc.
It uses opengl tesselate to produce "triangular" shapes. Other format dumpers can be added later.


P.S. Sorry for using qmake as build system only, but I got used to it - you're free to go to rewrite to cmake/etc.
